		<h2>A Little about Me (and My Website)!</h2>
		<p>My name is Hunter Key. I originally built this website during
		my senior year in high school as an assignment, though decided
		to maintain it as a way to show off myself. I am no graphic
		designer, but I wanted to do my best to present myself and
		all the things I am a part of. Listed below are some of my
		highlights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I am currently a freshman at the 
				<a href="https://www.usafa.af.mil/">US Air Force Academy</a> 
				in Colorado Springs. I am within the top 20% of my class, and 
				my short term goal is to become a fighter pilot.
				</li>
			<li>My ultimate goal is to one day go to space. My ideal is to use
				my pilot experience as a springboard with which to get into test
				pilot school, from which  hope to transition to the astronaut core.
				While I do not expect my journey to be as smooth as that, I have
				always loved the expression to shoot for the moon, because if you miss
				you will land among the stars.
			<li>Back to my high school days. I recieved recognition (and a spot
				at the academy) through multiple achievements and endeavors. I was
				the Manufacturing Captain of Cleveland High's 
				<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> 
				team, the 
				<a href="http://www.pigmice.com/">Pigmice.</a>
				I was also the varsity runningback on the football team, and I had the
				honor of being recognized as an Eagle Scout. Finally, I was a member of</li>
				Portland State's Aerospace Society 
				<a href="http://psas.pdx.edu/">(PSAS)</a>
				, a student led group that built sub-orbital rockets.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Feel free to see some of the photos I have taken of the things
		that I like to do and be a part of!</p>
