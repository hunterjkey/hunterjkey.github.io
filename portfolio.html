		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>This website was the first real HTML project that I've taken on
		and the quality of this website is a good reflection of my own
		abilities in web development. I hope that as my HTML skills improve,
		those improvements will become apparent in the quality of my 
		website.</p>
		<h3>This Page's Color Picker</h3>
		<p>Click one, I dare you</p>

		<h1 class="PortfolioHeadings">Chrome Extensions</h1>
		<h3>QuadCalc</h3>
		<p>My first, fully developed chrome extension. It solves the quadratic equation for its user. After asking 
		for three inputs about the equation to solve, the program does the entire calculation and displays the roots
		of that equation.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\QuadCalc.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h3>Random Selector</h3>
		<p>This is an extension I made with <a href="https://github.com/Fidosodd">Morgan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/colinhalebrown">Colin</a>
		 that selects a student or item randomly from a list that the user creates.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\RandomSelector.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h1 class="PortfolioHeadings">General Python</h1>
		<h3>Web Scraper</h3>
		<p>As a part of my IB Computer Science Course, I built my own 
		webscraper that could detect changes on a webpage. Instead of
		focusing on one website for my Web Scraper to work on, I tried
		to make it as general as possible so that it could function on
		any page. The scraper does this through two steps. First, it takes
		the ENTIRETY of the particular websites's HTML and converts it
		into a single string. From there, it counts the characters to see
		if the website's structure itself had changed. Secondly, it goes
		and finds the first paragraph tag within the website and analyzes
		any changes to that. A later update to the program also incorporated
		the "Twilio" module to send a mobile message to the user's phone
		when a change is detected.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\WebScraper.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h1 class="PortfolioHeadings">Pygame</h1>
		<p>This is a python module and I gave it its own section because 
		I made a lot of projects using this module. It's a really good
		tool for object oriented programming and I enjoyed using it.</p>
		<h3>TRON</h3>
		<p>A recreation of the old arcade game, TRON was my first 
		large project through pygame. The game features both a one
		player and two player mode. I created an AI (a generous title)
		for the computer player in the one player mode. It works
		by detecting it's relative distance to the walls and each of
		the player's lines, thereby avoiding each of them and staying
		alive for as long as possible. Besides the code, I also spent
		a considerable amount of time on the visuals and theme, which
		overall made the game much more appealing. For reference below,
		the blue line is a player and the orange line is the AI that I
		created for the game.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\TRON.gif"></div></div>
		
		<br>
		<h3>BattleShip</h3>
		<p>Based completely on the board game, Battleship is a one or
		two player game where each side is trying to sink all of each
		other's ships. I built another AI for this game and unlike the
		TRON AI, this one functioned with strategy. Upon finding a ship,
		 my AI would focus in on that general location on the map and
		 sink that specific ship. The game has multiple windows including
		 a title page, a help page, a setup page where each player can
		 place their ships, and the actual game page. The game also has
		 added themes that the player can choose from.</p>
		 <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\BattleShip.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h3>Conway's Game of Life</h3>
		<p>A misleading name, Conway's Game of Life is actually a mathematic/biological
		simulation reflecting the growth and death of populations. On a grid
		system, each individual grid is an organism whose sustained life or
		immediate death is based on its number of neighbors. Along with creating
		my own custom algorithm for this simulation, I also added a bunch of preset
		patterns that I can create on the grid, many of which are shown below. I found
		that allowing the patterns to loop around the screen required a lot more 
		processing speed and so I added the "borders on" setting to allow the user to turn
		that capability off if they want the program to run faster.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\GameOfLife.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h3>Chase</h3>
		<p>This was actually the first game I made, though it was sort of basic and not much happened
		and so I don't put it at the top. Anyway, chase was a simple "snake" like game where you try to 
		pick up the white circles without dying.
		There's perpetually a green square out to kill you and blue squares build up throughout the level
		to make it harder.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\Chase.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h3>Langston's Ant</h3>
		<p>Another simulation. In this one, an "ant" (the blue dot on the screen)
		travels around the grid. When the ant steps on a grid space, it uses a 
		preset pattern (given and changable along the side of the program) with which
		it both changes the color of that grid square and also moves in a certain 
		direction. For example, for the first part of this video below, when the ant 
		hits a black square, it changes that square to white and turns left. When it
		lands on a white square, it changes that square to red and turns right. This is not the only combination of movements and as mentioned
		above, the menu on the right can be used to change the ant's algorithm.</p>
		<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><div class="gif"><img style="width:100%" src="Videos\LangstonsAnt.gif"></div></div>
		
		<h3>Ideal Gas Law Simulation</h3>
		<p>This is a project I did for my Computer Science IA where I built a 
		simulation visualizing the ideal gas law for a physics teacher. The 
		program allows its users to choose two variables to 
		manipulate and then shows the relationship between those two variables.</p>

		<h3>"Get to Class"</h3>
		<p>A game I made for another one of my computer science courses. My game was about my character's unrealstic
		race to get to school before he is expelled for being absent too long. The game features
		a variety of different levels, such as a platformer game, a submarine-style level, 
		a scrolling shooter level, etc. Many of these levels are shown below.</p>
